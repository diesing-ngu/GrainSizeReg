## Predicted substrate types on the Norwegian continental margin

Spatial prediction of the seafloor substrate types on the Norwegian continental margin based on regional manual maps developed by the Geological Survey of Norway as part of the seafloor mapping programme MAREANO (https://mareano.no/en). The original classification contained twenty-six classes of substrate types. These were simplified to the following eight classes (original classes in brackets):

**Mud** (includes clay; silt; mud; mud with sediment blocks; gravelly mud)

**Sandy mud** (includes sandy clay; sandy mud; gravelly sandy mud)

**Muddy sand** (includes muddy sand; silty sand; gravelly muddy sand)

**Sand** (includes sand)

**Coarse sediment** (includes gravelly sand; sandy gravel; gravel; gravel and cobbles; sand, gravel and         cobbles; sand, gravel, cobbles and boulders)

**Mixed sediment** (includes muddy gravel; muddy sandy gravel)

**Rock and boulders** (includes gravel, cobbles and boulders; compacted sediments or sedimentary bedrock;       thin or discontinuous sediment cover on bedrock)

**Mosaic seafloor** (includes mud/sand with cobbles/boulders; mud and sand with gravel, cobbles and             boulders)


### Model outputs ###

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted substrate classes as defined above

* Prediction probabilities of the eight substrate classes

* Maximum probabilities, i.e., the probability of the classes that was mapped. Can be used as an indicator of map confidence.

* Area of applicability of the model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)
